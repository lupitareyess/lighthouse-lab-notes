### **Solving Problems with Pseudocode**

Using plain language to describe the solution you are going to implement 
- Take the time to understand what a problem is asking, and how to approach it without referencing any syntax at first 
- Break problem down into smaller pieces and work little by little 


### **Loopy Lighthouse Problem**

**Decription:** We need to write a program that prints the numbers from 100 to 200, but there are 3 exceptions:

1. If the number is a multiple of 3, print the string "Loopy".
2. If the number is a multiple of 4, print the string "Lighthouse".
3. If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 4, print the string "LoopyLighthouse".

The code to this problem is linked [here](/Week_1/Day_2/LoopyLighthouse_code.js)
