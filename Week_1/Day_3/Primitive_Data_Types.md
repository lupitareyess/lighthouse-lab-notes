## **Primitive Data Types**

There are 6 primitive data types in JS:

1. `undefined`
2. `null`
3. `boolean`
4. `string`
5. `number`
6. `symbol`

**NOTE:** In JS, all values which are not Objects, are collectively referred to as primitives. For examples, arrays and functions are Objects **NOT** primitives.

Primitives represent the simplest possible type of data software can have.
