## Higher Order Functions

- **Higher order funtions** = functions which operate on other functions

  - In other words, they take in callbacks
  - Build in functions such as `forEach` and `filter` are higher order functions

- `.filter` filters through array to return only the filtered elements
  - returns new array
  - `filter` evalutes `true` or `false`
    - if `true`, element will be returned into the new array
