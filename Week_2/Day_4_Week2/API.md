## What is an API

API = Application Programming Interface

- Allows systems to work together
- Sets of requirements that control how one application can talk to another
  -e.g. cutting and pasting relys on APIs
- Exposes a bit of programs internal functions to outside world
  - Lets app share data, take action
  - Define how a program will interact with the rest of the software world
    - Think about when apps ask for access to your camera or something - this is possible through APIs

### How do APIs work?

- Developers can use existing APIs to make their apps more efficient
  - E.g. using Dropbox to store gamer data
- Mix and match APIs to create new products

### APIs gone wrong?

- Might not always be available
  - Companies can restrict/limit access
- APIs can be shut down by companies, which can effect apps/services that were built off that API
