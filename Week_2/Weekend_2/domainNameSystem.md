## Domain Name System (DNS)

What happens in between the time a request is started and the time a response is given?

- **DNS!**

### DNS Resolution

- Translates domain names to machine readable IP addresses

## Record Types

- There are several but focus on the following:
  - `A`: maps hostname to IP address, most common
  - `NS`: Name Server
  - `MX`: Mail Exchange - specifies where email gets sent
  - `CNAME`: Canonical Name
  - `AAAA`: similar to `A`
- We can get information from websites using these record types
