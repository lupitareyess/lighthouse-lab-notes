## Intro to Template Englines

### What are templates?

- They are files that define the presentations of a web app's data
- They are seperated form the server logic
- Makes everything much more organized and manageable
- **For TinyApp project, temples will define the HTML of a page seperately from the logic in the express server**

### What is so useful about templates?

- Keeps server logic sepertae from markup
  - Easier to modify and debug without effecting other parts of the project
- Keeps HTML documents at a managable level and length

### Template Engines

- To use template files, we need a **template engine**
- Template engines replace variables in a template file with actual data, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client

- For TinyApp project, we'll be using **Embedded JavaScript (EJS)**
